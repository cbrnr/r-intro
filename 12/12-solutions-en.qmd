## Session 8, Exercise 1

First, we need to activate the `palmerpenguins` package to access the `penguins` data frame:

```{{r}}
library(palmerpenguins)
```

Next, we can display the two columns `bill_length_mm` and `bill_depth_mm` as a scatter plot:

```{{r}}
plot(
    penguins$bill_length_mm,
    penguins$bill_depth_mm,
    xlab="Bill length (mm)",
    ylab="Bill depth (mm)",
    pch=19,
    col="orange"
)
```


## Session 5, Exercise 1

We activate the `readr` package and can then display the documentation of the `read_delim()` function as follows:

```{{r}}
library(readr)
?read_delim
```

The following arguments are used:

- Column delimiter: `delim`
- Decimal separator: `locale`
- Missing values: `na`


## Session 6, Exercise 2

We already activated the `palmerpenguins` package in the first exercise.

The dimensions of the `penguins` data frame are:

```{{r}}
dim(penguins)
```

We can display a summary of all columns as follows:

```{{r}}
summary(penguins)
```

The factor columns `species` and `island` have three levels each. The `sex` column has two levels (including missing
values). There are two missing values in columns 3–6 and 11 missing values in the seventh column.

The means of columns 3–5 for each species are:

```{{r}}
by(penguins[, 3:5], penguins$species, colMeans, na.rm=TRUE)
```
````


## Exercise 2

The difference between the two blocks is that the first block (which is initiated with ` ```r `) only represents code as text (including colored syntax highlighting). However, this code is *not* executed!

The second block (which is initiated with ` ```{r} `) actually executes the code and displays the result.
